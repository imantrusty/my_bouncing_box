# Welcome to My Bouncing Box
***

## Task
Problem: Successfully make a box bounce between screen perimeters at a certain speed successfully.

## Description
I solved the problem by first doing research on how to make an object bounce on walls in JS. I then edited the code with a mentor to teach the box not to exeed the screen.

## Installation
This project can be installed through my github profile. Go to the folder and run it. 

## Usage
The code that has been formed allows a box to bounce on one's screen, similar to the DVD logo on old TVs. The speed can be edited and adjusted according to one's needs.
```
./my_boucing_box Can be run by opening the file in Github or Docode using a Live Server.
